# ParShift

ParShift is a python package based on [Gibson's framework](https://doi.org/10.1353/sof.2003.0055) for the analysis of conversational sequences.

The framework is established on the concept of participation shift, which refers to the shifting of individuals between the positions of speaker, target (addressee), and non-addressee (everyone else), in a group conversation.
