# ParShift

ParShift is a python package based on [Gibson's framework] for the analysis of
conversational sequences.

The framework is established on the concept of participation shift, which refers
to the shifting of individuals between the positions of speaker, target
(addressee), and non-addressee (everyone else), in a group conversation.
