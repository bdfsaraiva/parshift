# ParShift

ParShift is a python package based on [Gibson's framework](https://doi.org/10.1353/sof.2003.0055)
for the analysis of conversational sequences.

The framework is established on the concept of participation shift, which refers to
the shifting of individuals between the positions of speaker, target (addressee), and
non-addressee (everyone else), in a group conversation.

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install parshift
```

### From source

Directly using `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bdfsaraiva/parshift.git#egg=parshift
```

Or each step at a time:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bdfsaraiva/parshift
cd parshift
pip install .
```
